# Telecom Customers Churn Analysis

I'm excited to share the outcome of my Telecom Customers Churn analysis using the "story" feature on Tableau. This project was adventurous and fun, providing a great learning experience.

## Project Highlights:

- **Data Cleaning:**
  - Ensured data accuracy by removing unnecessary blank spaces and duplicates.

- **Google BigQuery Analysis:**
  - Leveraged Google BigQuery for in-depth analysis, uncovering hidden insights.

- **Tableau Dashboards:**
  - Created interactive dashboards on Tableau to visually represent key findings.

- **Tableau Story:**
  - Introduced the storytelling element by creating an interactive story on Tableau. ðŸ˜‰

## PS: Null Value Explanation

The "Null" value in the analysis represents customers without any internet service. Given this context, having "premium tech support" is impossible for them.

## Explore the Interactive Story:

Feel free to explore the interactive story on Tableau for a better understanding of the Telecom Customers Churn analysis.
